# Overview

In this project we are trying to make a text-based adventure game. This game allows the user to make choices to guide the story. The story is about a dragon cave and it allows the user to explore. 
The software that I wrote is a text-based adventure game implemented in C#. The game asks the player to enter their character's name and then takes them on a journey into the dragon's cave. 

The purpose is to demonstrate proficiency in C# by creating a game that provides an interactive fun experience that allows players to explore different routes.

# Development Environment

Some of the tools that I used to create this project include Visual Studio Code, Consol Application template, StreamWriter Class and I used github to hold my repository. 

I used C# as my programming language. For this project, I used the standard libraries from .NET Core.

# Future Work
- I need to fix the location of the text file
- I want to improve the data that we are adding to the text file. I want to add the  player's/ user's decisions
- I want to separate the different routes that the player/ user can choose into different files to make it easier to add and change in the future. 
- I want to add a user interface for the game.
