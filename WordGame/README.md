# Overview

In this project we are tring to make a text-based adventure game. This game allows the user to make choices to guide the story. The story is about a dragon cave an it allows the user to explore. 
The software that I wrot is a text-based adventure game implemented in C#. The game askes the player to enter their character's name and then takes them on a jurney into the dragon's cave. 

The purpose is to demonstrate proficiency in C# by creating a game that provides a interactive fun experience that allows players to explore different routes.

# Future Work
- I need to fix the location of the text file
- I want to improve the data that we are adding to the text file. I want to add the players/ users decisions
- I want to separate the different routes that the player/ user can choose into different file to make it easier to add and change in the future. 
- I want to add a user interface for the game.
